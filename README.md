###Ruby on Rails Learning

So, for this collection of projects...

 My recent push to learn web development started with Ruby on Rails around October, 2014. I chose Ruby because I had a particular project in mind and a developer suggested that I start with Ruby/Rails. I worked through the guide at https://www.railstutorial.org/book a couple of times and, while I was able to get the concepts, I realized I needed more work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript before all of it would come together for me.  Since then, I have become pretty excited about JavaScript, but plan on returning to Rails just to master the material that didn't stick before.
 
 These are a collection of tests, tutorials, and experiments that I worked on while learning Ruby and Rails. Be gentle...I didn't know exactly what I was doing then.
